Inspired by VitVector32 and BitArray, I created something of a cross between the two. ðŸ‘¹

Pull requests welcome, use at your own risk, the Star Wars universe has warned you.

The hope for this was to create an efficient (small), yet well defined, JWT claim that could
store user permissions or other flags. For instance when base64 encoding 128 different flags
(bits) it can be stored in a user claim as short as 22 characters. If each resource knows that
bit 7 is the permission to create new users you can use the claim to enable and disable user
controls to without needing to make calls to the user permissions store, etc.

Feel free to fork or submit a pull request if you feel you have an improvement. If you find a
bug file an issue and I'll  try to respond in a timely manner.
